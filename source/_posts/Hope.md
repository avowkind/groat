After 9 years at NIWA I have decided to hang out my shingle as an independent IT consultant.

This gives me more time to work on projects of personal interest and allows me to engage with a broader range of organisations where my leadership and software management skills can help to build and scale development teams, create processes and tools, raise overall production quality, and improve time to delivery while not burning out your team.

I am an experienced information technologist with a practical grasp of business; a strategic creative thinker and leader.

I have over 30 years of Software Development, Systems Architecture Design and Team Leadership across a range of industries including Health, Automotive, Mobile Phone, Environmental Science and Industrial Control. This includes operating my own company; leading a major start-up mobile phone company software team through a high growth period; and an executive CIO role responsible for 38 IT staff and $12m budget.

I have a clear track record as an innovative systems designer and project manager taking ideas from conception through implementation and delivery and into operation through a full business-process-aligned life cycle, managing teams using agile methodologies, leading edge tools and technologies.
