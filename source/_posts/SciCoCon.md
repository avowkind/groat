The [2017 Science Coding Conference](https://www.nesi.org.nz/news/2017/04/2017-science-coding-conference_) will be held from Tuesday August 1 to Wednesday August 2 at the Massey University Campus in central Wellington.

For 2017, we have changed the name from CRI Coding Conference to Science Coding Conference (SciCo!) to reflect the broadening audience of this event.

This event is for anyone involved in the programming side of NZ research. We encourage all research software engineers, IT managers, researchers and operational software developers from NZ Crown Research Institutes, universities and other public sector organisations to attend the conference.

Where: Tussock Venue, Massey University
Tasman Street, Entrance E,
Wellington Central, Wellington 6021

I'll be tweeting #SciCoCon2017

This will be attended by both pro software developers and science coders and it's an opportunity to meet peers and talk about tools, techniques, processes and challenges associated with developing robust scientific code and applications.
