It has been a very busy and interesting year. So busy that I've not had time to update my blog.

After leaving NIWA I spent the rest of the year providing consultation to Plant and Food and to the University of Auckland IT group.  Both roles associated with digital transformation and the use of agile, cloud, dev ops etc in those businesses.

In January I started a new role at NZTA in a group called connected journeys. Although billed as a Product Manager role. This turned out to be another digital transformation role as the group was very new and needed to setup almost a complete new IT group - developing teams, organsational structure, business and technology processes, managing rapid growth etc.  While at the same time we had to get to understand a byzantine government agency that was more used to atoms than bits.
While there is a lot of interesting stuff going on - in the end this work was not about product development in the sense I'm used to.

Highlights were the two Hackathons we ran.

I'm now available for new permanent or contract work in software development and product mangagement.
